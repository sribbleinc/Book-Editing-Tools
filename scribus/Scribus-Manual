NAME
    scribus - Scribus Python interface module

FILE
    (built-in)

DESCRIPTION
    This module is the Python interface for Scribus. It provides functions
    to control scribus and to manipulate objects on the canvas. Each
    function is documented individually below.
    
    A few things are common across most of the interface.
    
    Most functions operate on frames. Frames are identified by their name,
    a string - they are not real Python objects. Many functions take an
    optional (non-keyword) parameter, a frame name.
    Many exceptions are also common across most functions. These are
    not currently documented in the docstring for each function.
    - Many functions will raise a NoDocOpenError if you try to use them
    without a document to operate on.
    - If you do not pass a frame name to a function that requires one,
    the function will use the currently selected frame, if any, or
    raise a NoValidObjectError if it can't find anything to operate
    on.
    - Many functions will raise WrongFrameTypeError if you try to use them
    on a frame type that they do not make sense with. For example, setting
    the text color on a graphics frame doesn't make sense, and will result
    in this exception being raised.
    - Errors resulting from calls to the underlying Python API will be
    passed through unaltered. As such, the list of exceptions thrown by
    any function as provided here and in its docstring is incomplete.
    
    Details of what exceptions each function may throw are provided on the
    function's documentation, though as with most Python code this list
    is not exhaustive due to exceptions from called functions.

FUNCTIONS
    applyMasterPage(...)
        applyMasterPage(masterPageName, pageNumber)
        
        Apply master page masterPageName on page pageNumber.
    
    changeColor(...)
        changeColor("name", c, m, y, k)
        
        Changes the color "name" to the specified CMYK value. The color value is defined via four components c = Cyan, m = Magenta, y = Yellow and k = Black. Color components should be in the range from 0 to 255.
        
        May raise NotFoundError if the named color wasn't found. May raise ValueError if an invalid color name is specified.
    
    closeDoc(...)
        closeDoc()
        
        Closes the current document without prompting to save.
        
        May throw NoDocOpenError if there is no document to close
    
    closeMasterPage(...)
        closeMasterPage()
        
        Closes the currently active master page, if any, and returns editing to normal. Begin editing with editMasterPage().
    
    createBezierLine(...)
        createBezierLine(list, ["name"]) -> string
        
        Creates a new bezier curve and returns its name. The points for the bezier curve are stored in the list "list" in the following order: [x1, y1, kx1, ky1, x2, y2, kx2, ky2...xn. yn, kxn. kyn] In the points list, x and y mean the x and y coordinates of the point and kx and ky meaning the control point for the curve.  The coordinates are given in the current measurement units of the document (see UNIT constants). "name" should be a unique identifier for the object because you need this name for further access to that object. If "name" is not given Scribus will create one for you.
        
        May raise NameExistsError if you explicitly pass a name that's already used. May raise ValueError if an insufficient number of points is passed or if the number of values passed don't group into points without leftovers.
    
    createCharStyle(...)
        createCharStyle(...)
        
        Creates a character style. This function takes the following keyword parameters:
        
        "name" [required] -> name of the char style to create
        
        "font" [optional] -> name of the font to use
        
        fontsize [optional] -> font size to set (double)
        
        "features" [optional] -> nearer typographic details can be defined by a string that might contain the following phrases comma-seperated (without spaces!):
        
        -> inherit
        
        -> bold
        
        -> italic
        
        -> underline
        
        -> underlinewords
        
        -> strike
        
        -> superscript
        
        -> subscript
        
        -> outline
        
        -> shadowed
        
        -> allcaps
        
        -> smallcaps
        
        "fillcolor" [optional], "fillshade" [optional] -> specify fill options
        
        "strokecolor" [optional], "strokeshade" [optional] -> specify stroke options
        
        baselineoffset [optional] -> offset of the baseline
        
        shadowxoffset [optional], shadowyoffset [optional] -> offset of the shadow if used
        
        outlinewidth [optional] -> width of the outline if used
        
        underlineoffset [optional], underlinewidth [optional] -> underline options if used
        
        strikethruoffset [optional], strikethruwidth [optional] -> strikethru options if used
        
        scaleh [optional], scalev [optional] -> scale of the chars
        
        tracking [optional] -> tracking of the text
        
        "language" [optional] -> language code
    
    createEllipse(...)
        createEllipse(x, y, width, height, ["name"]) -> string
        
        Creates a new ellipse on the current page and returns its name. The coordinates are given in the current measurement units of the document (see UNIT constants). "name" should be a unique identifier for the object because you need this name for further referencing of that object. If "name" is not given Scribus will create one for you.
        
        May raise NameExistsError if you explicitly pass a name that's already used.
    
    createImage(...)
        createImage(x, y, width, height, ["name"]) -> string
        
        Creates a new picture frame on the current page and returns its name. The coordinates are given in the current measurement units of the document. "name" should be a unique identifier for the object because you need this name for further access to that object. If "name" is not given Scribus will create one for you.
        
        May raise NameExistsError if you explicitly pass a name that's already used.
    
    createLayer(...)
        createLayer(layer)

        Shows a File Open dialog box with the caption "caption". Files are filtered with the filter string "filter". A default filename or file path can also supplied, leave this string empty when you don't want to use it.  A value of True for haspreview enables a small preview widget in the FileSelect box.  When the issave parameter is set to True the dialog acts like a "Save As" dialog otherwise it acts like a "File Open Dialog". When the isdir parameter is True the dialog shows and returns only directories. The default for all of the optional parameters is False.
        
        The filter, if specified, takes the form 'comment (*.type *.type2 ...)'. For example 'Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)'.
        
        Refer to the Qt-Documentation for QFileDialog for details on filters.
